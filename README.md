# curl-installer-sh

This is an example installer.sh generator based on codemeta.json + a Pandoc template. There is an example Makefile
as well as example generators for an about.md page and CITATION.cff. All the examples use Pandoc 3 or better to
rendering their contents based on the codemeta.json file.
